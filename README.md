Legend:

[1] POS/ATM Simulator: GUI tool (customize, send, and see responses; TCP/HTTP switchable)
[2] Admin Dashboard: Login, visualize transactions, see ISO docs, audit logs, real-time updates
    Main Engine: Parses, tokenizes, logs, routes, persists, calls fraud, exposes APIs for tools
     Everything is pluggable, see-through, and auditable for QA, audit, and learning


_+ POS/ATM Simulator [GUI]: Dual-mode, randomization, and full ISO field control‚Äîmassively improved dev UX.

_+ Admin Dashboard: Graphical, with search, drilldown, and real-time visualization‚Äîmakes audit/training accessible.

_+ Fraud Engine: Clean, modular REST microservice (pluggable for ML/rule engines).

_+ Core Switch: Still the heart‚Äînow positioned as part of a suite, not a lonely engine.

_+ Database Layer: Persistence in Postgres for queries, history, and regression/audit trails.

_+ End-to-End Visibility: Every flow is ‚Äúseeable‚Äù and interactive for users, not just a backend protocol pipe.

```

### 1. **(a) POS/ATM Simulator (GUI or Real Device) sends ISO 8583 Message (TCP or HTTP)**

* *Can be a physical terminal, a Python/Java FakePOS, or your drag-and-drop GUI Simulator.*
* **Dual Mode:**

  * Sends payment or reversal requests as raw ISO 8583 over **TCP** (realistic)
  * Or as **HTTP** (for developer/test automation).

---

### 2. **Floss83 Card Switch Engine (Spring Boot / Java) receives the message**

* **Parses** full ISO 8583 structure (MTI, all fields).
* **Tokenizes PAN/CVV immediately** with TokenizationService;
  **no raw PAN/CVV ever appears in logs or leaves this layer.**
* **PCI audit logs** capture every transformation and access, but always masked.
* **Transaction is persisted to Postgres** for traceability, regression, and audit history.

---

### 3. **Fraud Check Engine (Python FastAPI Microservice)**

* **Switch engine makes a REST call** (tokenized payload) to the fraud engine.
* **Fraud engine scores**: rule/ML logic returns risk score, ‚Äúfraud‚Äù, or ‚Äúclean.‚Äù
* **Fraud results are logged** and attached to the transaction.

---

### 4. **Admin Dashboard & Real-time Flow Visualization**

* **Web-based dashboard**:

  * Admin login, view/search all ISO 8583 messages
  * Drilldown on every field with human-friendly ISO docs
  * See audit logs, risk flags, and tokens per transaction
  * Real-time graphical flow: watch live traffic and ‚Äúpacket trace‚Äù animations of end-to-end journey
* **Side-by-side or multi-window UX:**

  * Launch POS simulator and dashboard together for ‚Äúsee everything‚Äù mode

---

### 5. **Downstream Bank/Card Network (Simulated Endpoint)**

* **Switch forwards approved ISO 8583 messages** to a real or dummy downstream (bank/network simulator, test harness, or sandbox).
* **Simulated bank returns approve/decline,** for a true E2E roundtrip (all fully logged).

---

### **How each part connects:**

* **POS/ATM Simulator (GUI or script) ‚Üí Card Switch Engine (TCP/HTTP) ‚Üí Fraud Check Engine (REST) ‚Üí Dashboard (Web) ‚Üí Bank/Network Simulator**
* **No clear cardholder data leaves the switch at any point‚Äîonly tokens.**
* **Every step (parse, tokenize, fraud, route, audit) is logged, visualized, and queryable.**

---

## **How Modern Fintech Infra Works (FLOSS83 Edition):**

* **Legacy rails (ISO8583 over TCP/HTTP) for full realism.**
* **New school fraud/risk scoring via Python microservice (REST, ML ready).**
* **Full persistence, E2E traceability, and zero-trust PCI masking.**
* **Everything wrapped in GUIs, dashboards, and visual tools for real adoption, onboarding, and education.**

---

**No black boxes. No more ‚ÄúWTF is happening.‚Äù
Just plug, play, see, and trust every message flow‚Äî*the modern way*.**

## üöß Branch 4: Tokenization & HSM Simulator (core/tokenization-hsm-sim) üöß

> _‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt explain it to your grandma or a summer intern, you don‚Äôt deserve to run prod.‚Äù_

### üß© **What‚Äôs New?**

- Plugged a PCI-style tokenization and ‚Äòfake ass vault‚Äô layer (HsmSimulator + TokenizationService) into the core JavaSwitch
- All PAN and CVV data now **locked up** with strong AES encryption before anything touches it downstream
- Every operation is **audit-logged** (timestamp, event type, input/output masked, status)
- Tampered tokens get you a loud FAIL in the logs (hacker? back to school, bitch)
- _No DB, no cloud, no prod secrets‚Äîdev only, but ready for a real HSM drop-in when it matters_
